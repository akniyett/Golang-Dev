# Health Control

Task: most of us do not know our body quotient and do not sleep well.

Task covers: this program shows a person's body ratio and estimates the wake-up time on the given current time. While realizing this task I used such packages as fmt - to print out the resule, math - to calculate body ratio, time - to estimate current time to calculate waking up time, net/http -  for requests in the server. Stay healthy :)
